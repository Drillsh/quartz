- Aren't you sick of failing?
- No! That's the whole point!  
  <mark class="hltr-red">We must never stop failing, because the minute we do, we've failed.</mark>  
  Look, none of us here can say our lives have gone the way we had hoped for.  
  Right?  
  ...  
  I'm the champion of failures!  
  I lost everything that ever mattered to me and it was all my fault.  
  Which is exactly why I can't quit.
